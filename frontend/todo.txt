Add copy from DAY of this roster.
So you could choose to copy from yesterday for example
DONE and it updates state, which updates everything..but the new items arent created?

Add automatic group reordering. //DONE
Or groups automatically order when you create, //DONE
Then there is a button to reorder shifts when you want. //NOT DOING

Perhaps a button to reorder groups to alphebetic order? //NOT DOING

Add a way to complete a days roster, so you put in each employees end time //THIS IS KIND OF ALREADY A THING

A way to print rosters.
